RCOS Dashboard is a web app for checking on the status of the active projects sponsored by the Rensselaer Center for Open Source. It's hosted at http://rcos-monitor.heroku.com/, and this is the code for it. I threw it together in a couple of hours, so there are plenty of things I'd like to improve with it. Moving from projects.yml to a database might be a good idea, but it would be problematic with the Heroku caching infrastructure: I couldn't see updates reflected immediately. Anyway, feel free to fork and make suggestions!
