<h1>Project created</h1>
<p>Your project, <%= @project.name %>, has been successfully created.
  It will show up on the <%= link_to 'main page', :action => :index %> once it has 
  been approved by the administrator.</p>
  
<p>The password for your project is <span class="pass"><%= @project.password %></span>.
  Keep this in a safe place, as it is required for updating project attributes later on.</p>

<%= link_to 'Home', :action => :index %>
